    <h4>Thai red curry with chicken</h4>
    <p>We’d all love to be able to have a Thai Red Curry any night of the week made with homemade red curry paste. Freshly made, like the best Thai restaurants do every day. But it’s simply not viable.</p>

    <p>So today, I’m sharing a recipe for how to make Thai Red Curry</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cans of thai red curry paste</li>
            <li>5 tbsp of coconut oil</li>
            <li>1 cup of chicken broth</li>
            <li>14oz of coconut milk</li>
            <li>6 kaffir lime leaves</li>
            <li>4 tbsp of palm sugar</li>
            <li>Fish sauce</li>
            <li>12 oz of chicken thigh</li>
            <li>2 bushels of basil</li>
            <li>1 can of bamboo shoots</li>
            <li><em>Optional:</em> Peas and carrots</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based skillet over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Add curry paste and cook on high heat for 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li>Add chicken broth and stir to dissolve paste. Simmer rapidly for 3 minutes or until liquid reduces by half.</li>
            <li>Add coconut milk and chicken. Cover and cook until chicken is done, 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn heat down and add palm sugar, kaffir lime leaves, bamboo shoots, and fish sauce to taste. </li>
            <li>Add basil and optional peas and carrots, and simmer for two more minutes. Remove from heat</li>
            <li>Serve with jasmine rice and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
